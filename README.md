Hello, Iâ€™m Cullen ðŸ‘‹
I study Computer Science at Tidewater Community College.
This is my final year before heading to a four year university. 
Before studying CS, I completed a Bachelor's Degree in Speech Pathology (Communications Sciences and Disorders) from James Madison University. 
Having previous degree experience in the Health Sciences makes my approach to programming both diagnostic and human centered. I'm able to discern user needs easily (even when not explicitly stated) and implement solutions that create value. 

What motivates me to code is the constant creativity, learning, and problem solving. 

Last Spring, I was a member of Old Dominion University's Innovate Cyber Cohort.
Innovate Cyber was an experiential learning experience where I worked within a team setting to identify user challenges related to cybersecurity. Using the design approach to problem-solving, my team employed User Experience skills and created a prototype project to alleviate accessibility challenges to learning safe Cyber Security practices. Although no coding was involved with this experience, it taught me the importance of understanding users and how to innovate a solution to resolve their pain-points. I learned how to use technology for implementing positive change and solutions.

I look forward to continuing my studies and gaining more exposure to the field of CS.
