- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Cullen
-  I am in my final year at Tidewater Community College for Computer Sceince.
-  Before studying CS, I completed two certificates at the college. One in Mobile Applications Development and 
the other in Web Development. 

I greatly enjoy the problem-solving and creative aspects of programming. 

Last Spring, I was a member of Old Dominion University's Innovate Cyber Cohort.
This was an experenial learning experience where I worked within a team setting to identify a challenge related to cybersecurity. Using the design approach to problem solving, my team employed User Experience skills and created a prototype project that aimed to solve accessibility challenges to learning safe Cyber Security practices. Although there was no coding involved with this experience, it taught me the importance of understanding users and how to innovate a solution to resolve their painpoints. I learned that technology is a powerful tool that can be used for progress and change.

I look forward to continuing my studies and gaining more exposure to the field of CS.
